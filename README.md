# QR-Codie

## 1. Project Goal & Introduction

This app is a **client-side web application** implementing a simple intermittent fasting PWA. Use the app to determine if you are allowed to start eating again by tracking your fasting period.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React with TypeScript, Vite
  - Standard browser APIs
  - NVM (use 22), bun 1.2.9+
- **Styling:**
  - Minimal CSS for a modern, responsive layout

## 3. Core Functionality & User Flow

### Initial State

- User launches the app and is prompted with a clean, modern interface.
- The main view shows an option to start a fast, and if a fast is already active, a countdown timer displaying the remaining time.

### Starting a Fast

- **Action:** User clicks the “Start Fast” button.
- **Data Storage:** The current epoch time is saved in Local Storage.
- **Countdown:** A timer starts that calculates the remaining fasting period based on the preset fasting duration.

### Countdown Timer

- **Display:** The timer shows the remaining hours and minutes until the fasting period ends.
- **Calculation:** Uses the saved epoch time from Local Storage and the duration setting to render a live countdown.

### Finishing a Fast

- When the countdown reaches zero, the UI updates to indicate that the eating window is open.
- The user is prompted or allowed to reset/start a new fasting period.

## 4. UX Design Specifications

### UI/UX Principles

- **Modern & Minimalist:**

  - Clean layout with ample whitespace.
  - Minimal dependencies to keep the application lightweight.
  - Use of CSS Flexbox/Grid for responsive design.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - User interface adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
  - Readable typography and touch-friendly controls.

### Key Components

1. **Hero Section:**

   - Central area with the application title and a brief description of the fasting concept.
   - “Start Fast” button prominently displayed.

2. **Countdown Timer:**

   - When a fast is active, show a large, easy-to-read timer.
   - Timer dynamically updates to show hours and minutes remaining.
   - Clearly indicate when the fasting period is over, potentially with a color change or animation.

3. **Settings Panel:**

   - Accessible either from a dedicated settings icon or on an initial setup screen.
   - **Fasting Duration:**
     - Input to set the number of fasting hours (or alternatively, the length of the eating window).
     - The duration setting is saved locally and used for initializing the countdown timer.
   - **Data Persistence:**
     - Utilize Local Storage to record the epoch time when the fast was started and the user’s fasting settings.
     - Option to reset or adjust settings if required.

4. **Notifications & Feedback:**
   - Visual cues when the fast starts and ends.
   - Optionally, a simple sound or vibration alert (using browser APIs) to signal the transition.

### Interaction Flow

- **On Load:**
  - Check Local Storage for any active fast session.
  - If an active session is found, calculate the remaining time and display the countdown.
  - If no active session, display the “Start Fast” prompt with clear instructions.
- **On User Action:**
  - When “Start Fast” is clicked, store the current epoch time and launch the countdown.
  - Allow users to modify fasting settings via the settings panel before starting a fast.
- **Post Fast:**
  - After the countdown ends, update the interface to indicate the fast is complete.
  - Provide an option to restart the fast or go to the settings panel.

## 5. Fasting History & Cheat Days

### History Tracking

- **Successful Fasts:** Each time a user completes the full fasting duration set in the settings, it's recorded as a successful fast.
- **Duration Records:** The application tracks and displays the user's longest and shortest successfully completed fast durations.
- **Data Storage:** Fasting history data (successful fasts, durations) is stored locally using Local Storage.

### Cheat Days

- **Weekly Allowance:** Users are allocated 2 "cheat days" per week.
- **Manual Activation:** A dedicated button allows the user to consciously take a cheat day, bypassing the need to start a fast for that day.
- **Automatic Consumption:** If a user stops an active fast before the set duration is complete, one cheat day is automatically consumed.
- **Tracking:** The number of remaining cheat days for the current week is displayed and updated in the UI.

### Visualization

- **Monthly Overview:** A bar graph is displayed at the bottom of the screen, visualizing the last 30 days.
- **Daily Representation:** Each bar in the graph represents a single 24-hour period.
- **Eating Window:** Within each daily bar, a thicker segment visually indicates the start and end times of the eating window for that day, based on the completed fast. Days where a cheat day was taken or no fast was recorded will be visually distinct.

## 6. Conclusion

QR-Codie aims to provide a straightforward, user-friendly interface for managing intermittent fasting, with minimal distractions and dependencies. By leveraging modern web standards, Local Storage for persistence, and a clean React-based UI, the app ensures a delightful and responsive experience.
